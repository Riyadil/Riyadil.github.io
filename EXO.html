                <p>Exo-K's leader, Suho, was the first member to join SM Entertainment,
                    after a successful audition through the company's casting system in 
                    2006. The following year, Kai, with encouragement from his father, 
                    auditioned at the SM Youth Best Contest; he won and received a contract.
                     Chanyeol, who took second place in a Smart Model Contest, and Sehun,
                      who went through four auditions in two years, were the next members to 
                      become trainees in 2008. In 2010, Exo-K's D.O. sang for his audition and
                       was eventually offered a contract. The last member of Exo-K to become
                        a trainee was Baekhyun, who joined in 2011 through SM Entertainment's
                         casting system and trained for approximately one year before debut. 
                         In Exo-M, Kris auditioned in 2008 at a global SM Entertainment audition
                          in Canada, before moving to South Korea for training. That same year, Lay 
                          auditioned in Changsha, China, and subsequently moved to South Korea, while 
                          Xiumin attended an audition with his friend and won second place.
                           In 2010, Luhan was scouted by an SM Entertainment representative in Seoul 
                           and passed his audition, while Tao was scouted at a talent show. The last
                            member to join Exo-M was Chen, who took part in the casting system in 2011. 
                            The band's first televised performance was at the annual SBS Gayo Daejeon 
                            event on December 29, 2011. Exo-K and Exo-M debuted with the single "Mama" on April 8, 2012, followed by the EP Mama on April 9.
                            [11] The two sub-groups promoted the album separately; Exo-K performed on South Korean music program The Music Trend while Exo-M 
                            performed on the Top Chinese Music Awards in Shenzhen on the same day.[12] The Korean version of the EP peaked at number one on 
                            South Korea's Gaon Album Chart[13] and at number eight on the Billboard World Albums Chart,[14] while the Mandarin version reached 
                            number two on China's Sina Album Chart and number one on various Chinese streaming platforms. Prior its debut, Exo released two singles, 
                            titled "What Is Love" and "History", which peaked at number 88 on and number 68 respectively on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number 
                            six on the Sina Music Chart.[15] Exo was awarded Best New Asian Group at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards and the Newcomer Award

                    The group's first studio album, XOXO, was released on June 3, 2013,
                    in two versions: one in Korean and one in Mandarin.
                    Unlike the EP Mama, for which Exo-K and Exo-M had separate 
                    promotions, XOXO was jointly promoted, mainly in South Korea.
                    Exo recorded the album's lead single "Wolf" together, but the
                    rest of the album tracks were recorded separately.
                    A repackaged version of the album, titled Growl, was released 
                     on August 5, 2013, with three additional tracks. New single 
                    "Growl" peaked at number three on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100
                    and at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. All versions of XOXO 
                    collectively sold over one million copies, making Exo the first South
                     Korean artists to reach that milestone in 12 years.
                     That December, Exo released a second EP, Miracles in December, as a 
                     special winter album containing the single of the same name.
                     Prior to the release, the group promoted the album through their 
                     first reality show, Exo's Showtime, which premiered on November 28,
                      2013 on the cable channel MBC Every 1. Following their 2013 releases, 
                      Exo won Song of the Year at the Melon Music Awards for "Growl",
                       Disc Daesang at the Golden Disc Awards and Album of the Year at the 
                       Mnet Asian Music Awards for XOXO, and the Daesang at the Seoul 
                       Music Awards. In addition, Exo-M received the Most Popular Group 
                       Award at the 2013 Top Chinese Music Awards.Exo's third EP, Overdose, was released on May 7, 2014.
                       Originally scheduled to be released on April 21, the album was 
                       delayed due to the Sewol Ferry accident on April 16. Overdose was 
                       promoted similarly to Mama, with Exo-K in South Korea and Exo-M 
                       promoting primarily in China. The album had over 660,000 pre-orders, 
                       making it the most pre-ordered Korean EP in history. The Korean edition 
                       also peaked at number two on Billboard's World Albums Chart, and at
                       number 129 on the Billboard 200, making Exo the highest-ever charting male
                        Korean group at that time.[30][31] Overdose became the best selling release 
                        of 2014 in South Korea, and was the first EP to top the yearly charts and win 
                        the Album of the Year Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. On December
                         22, Exo released their first live album, Exology Chapter 1: The Lost Planet
                       The album's single, "December, 2014 (The Winter's Tale)", peaked at number
                        one on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it Exo's first number one single.
                        By the end of 2014, Exo was Japan's best-selling K-pop artist of the year.

                <p>On March 7, 2015, Exo began their second headlining world tour, "Exoplanet 2 – 
                    The Exo'luxion", with 70,000 attendees across five nights at the Olympic
                     Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. The group released its second studio album
                      Exodus on March 30, 2015, in both Korean and Mandarin versions.
                      Domestic pre-orders for the album surpassed 500,000 copies within 24 hours,
                    setting a new record for pre-orders. Lead single "Call Me Baby" was released
                    ahead of schedule, on March 27, because versions of the song had been leaked
                     online. The music videos were released four days later; the Korean version 
                     later became the most-watched K-pop music video of the first half of 2015.
                     The album spent a record four consecutive weeks at number one on the Gaon
                      Album Chart and sold over a million copies, making it Exo's second album 
                      to do so, after XOXO Exodus won Album of the Year at the 2015 Mnet Asian 
                      Music Awards, giving Exo their third consecutive win. In April 2015, 
                      Exodus peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard 200, making the group 
                      the highest charting Korean artist.Exo also entered Billboard's Canadian 
                      Hot 100 chart at number 98, making them the first K-pop group and second 
                      Korean artist to chart there.  On November 4, 2015, Exo released their Japanese debut single Love Me Right 
                      ~romantic universe~, which contains the Japanese version of "Love Me Right" 
                      and an original Japanese song titled "Drop That". On the day of its release, 
                      the album sold 147,000 copies and reached the top of the Oricon chart, 
                      becoming the all-time best-selling debut single in Japan by a Korean artist.
                      Five days later, Exo released a special single titled "Lightsaber" to 
                      promote the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens ahead of its release in South 
                      Korea, as part of a collaboration between SM Entertainment and Walt Disney. 
                      On December 10, Exo released its second winter special release and fourth EP, 
                      Sing for You, containing the singles "Sing for You" and "Unfair". The album 
                      sold 267,900 copies in its first week, breaking the record for the highest 
                      first-week sales by a Korean artist. "Unfair" also became the first K-pop 
                      song to be featured in the "Best of the Week" playlist by Apple Music, and 
                      Exo became the first Korean artists to appear on the platform's homepage. 
                      Part of the profits from the album were donated to UNICEF's Smile For U 
                      campaign, to support the music education for children in Asia. In December 
                      2015, South Korean entertainment industry leaders ranked Exo at number seven 
                      in the top ten pop culture leaders of 2015, the highest rank held by a K-pop 
                      artist.<br> <br> <br></p>

                <p>Exo's third studio album Ex'Act and its singles, "Lucky One" and "Monster", were released on June 9, 2016, in both Korean and 
                    Mandarin versions.[62] Domestic pre-orders for the album exceeded 660,000 copies, making it the most pre-ordered K-pop album ever 
                    at that time.[63] The album broke the record for the highest first-week sales of a Korean album, previously set by the band's own 
                    fourth EP Sing For You.[64] "Monster" became Exo's first number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, and "Lucky One" debuted 
                    at number three.[65] On August 18, 2016, a repackaged edition of the album, titled Lotto, was released; it added four new songs, including 
                    the single of the same name.[66] "Lotto" became Exo's second number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs Chart, and peaked at number two 
                    on the Gaon Digital Chart.[67] The repackaged edition's Korean and Mandarin versions reached number one and two on the Gaon Album Chart, 
                    respectively[68][69] Within two months of its original release, Ex'Act had sold over 1.17 million copies, becoming Exo's third album to 
                    sell over one million copies, earning them the title of "triple million sellers" from the media.[70]<br> 
                    On July 22, Exo embarked on its third headlining tour, "Exoplanet 3 – The Exo'rdium", with a record six consecutive concerts at the Olympic 
                    Gymnastics Arena.[74] On May 28, 2017, the tour ended with the second of two consecutive concerts at the Seoul Olympic Stadium, the largest 
                    stadium in South Korea, with an estimated maximum seating capacity of 100,000.[75] Tickets for the first date went on sale on April 12 and were 
                    sold out within 20 minutes.[76] The tour brought the band's total number of concerts to over 100.[77] In June, Lay announced he would not take 
                    part in the band's next album, and would instead focus on his acting career. Since then, he has been absent from Exo albums and public appearances.
                    [78] On December 7, Exo released their second Japanese single, "Coming Over".[79] Selling over 158,000 copies, it reached number two on the weekly 
                    Oricon Chart and became the band's second Japanese single to receive a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan.[80] 
                    Exo's third winter release and fifth EP For Life was released on December 19.[81] The band did not publicly promote the album, which sold over 442,000 
                    copies in less than two weeks.<br>
                    Also in 2016, the group's members spent time advancing their solo careers. On January 7, Baekhyun released "Dream", a collaboration with popular South 
                    Korean singer Suzy. The single proved very popular, and won Best Collaboration at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards among other awards.[83] On October 31,
                    Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin debuted as the group's first sub-unit, Exo-CBX,[84] which is a combination of the first letter from each member's stage name. 
                    Exo-CBX released their debut EP Hey Mama! and the music video for the single of the same name on October 31.[85] The EP was a success, selling over 
                    293,897 copies.[86] As of 2018, they have released two EPs in Korean and two EPs in Japanese.[84] Lay's debuted as a solo artist in May 2016 with the 
                    release of "Monodrama" through the project SM Station. The song was a success in China, ranking number one on Billboard China V Chart for four consecutive 
                    weeks.[87] On October 28, Lay released his debut EP, Lose Control. It was a commercial success, breaking several Guinness World Records[88] and debuted at 
                    number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart.[89] In 2016 he also acted in The Mystic Nine, a television show in China that drew over 12 billion views online.
                    [90] All of the other members also pursued solo activities in various industries, including music, film, television, and theater. Exo-CBX debuted in Japan on 
                    May 24, 2017, with the release of an EP titled Girls,[91] which followed the release of a short version of the music video for the lead single "Ka-CHING!" in 
                    late April.[92] The EP sold over 60,000 copies in Japan within a month of its release. <br>
                    Exo's fourth studio album The War was released on July 18, 2017.[94] The album had received 807,235 pre-orders, surpassing the band's own record of 660,000 for Ex'Act.[95] Lead single "Ko Ko Bop" debuted at number one on the Melon Digital Chart, making Exo the first K-pop group to enter at number one after chart changes were implemented on February 27, 2017.[96] Upon release, the album recorded the highest first week sales of any K-pop album.[97] It debuted at number 87 on the Billboard 200, number one on the Billboard World Albums Chart, and on many other charts around the world – a first for Exo.[98][99][100] On August 29, the 2018 edition of the Guinness World Records named Exo as having won the "Most Daesang" (grand prize) awards at the Mnet Asian Music Awards.[101] On September 5, the group released a repackaged edition of The War, titled The War: The Power of Music. It added three new songs to the tracklist, including the single "Power".[102] On September 14, "Power" recorded the all-time highest score on M Countdown with 11,000 points, which made Exo the first artists to achieve a perfect score after the show's calculation system changes were implemented in June 2015. The win also marked the group's 100th win on a music show.[103]

                    Exo began their third world tour, "Exoplanet#4 – The EℓyXiOn", with three consecutive nights at Seoul's Gocheok Sky Dome, beginning on November 24.[104] 
                    As of November 30, Korean sales of The War had reportedly reached nearly 1.6 million copies, making it Exo's best selling album at the time and earning 
                    the group the title of "quadruple million sellers" from the media.[105][106] In early December, Exo announced its fourth special winter release and sixth 
                    EP, Universe. It was originally due for release on December 21, but was delayed until December 26 because of the death of labelmate Jonghyun. <br>
                    During Exo's concert tour Exo Planet 4 – The Elyxion, Chanyeol and Sehun performed a song together titled "We Young" in Seoul and Macau in July and 
                    August 2018 respectively. The song was then released digitally through SM Station X 0 on September 14, 2018.[3] <br>

                    Chanyeol and Sehun debuted as Exo's second sub-unit and first duo in July.[4] On June 28, the unit's name was announced to be Exo-SC (shortened from 
                    SeChan), after the first letter of the members' names.[5] On the same day, it was announced that the unit will release their first extended play titled 
                    What a Life on July 22, which contains six tracks.[6] Exo-SC received their first-ever music show win on KBS's Music Bank on August 2, eleven days after 
                    their debut.[7] <br>
                    On June 12, Cass Fresh, a notable beer in South Korea, announced that Exo-SC became their brand endorser.[8] On June 23, it was announced that the 
                    unit will release their first full album 1 Billion Views on July 13, which contains nine tracks.[9] <br> <br></p>
